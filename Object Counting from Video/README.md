## Overview
This program performs real-time vehicle detection and tracking in a video stream. It uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection, specifically the YOLOv8 Large model, to detect vehicles in each frame of the video. The detected vehicles are then tracked using the SORT algorithm to maintain consistent IDs and track their movements across frames. The program also provides visualizations by drawing bounding boxes around the detected and tracked vehicles, as well as displaying the count of vehicles that have crossed a certain region of interest.
